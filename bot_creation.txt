First to create your bot you need to go to : https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started

Click on the blue "create app" button.

If you are not already you will have to sign into your discord account.

(may I recommend that you do not use your normal discord account but a new one just for developpement as you might not want your data to be related to this bot)

Give a name to your app

Welcome to your app management space.

Open the navigation bar at the top left corner of the page.
